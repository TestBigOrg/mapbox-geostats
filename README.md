# mapbox-geostats

Generate statistics about geodata.

The initial plan:

- A CLI and Node API that take source files with geographic data as input and produce statistics about that data as output.
- Supported input formats:
  - GeoJSON
  - shapefiles
  - mbtiles
- Use mapnik to parse and analyze GeoJSON and shapefiles.

More to come.
